The wind whipped around me, biting at my face, already numb from the cold. The snow, falling in fat flakes, clung to my coat and the heavy suitcase in my hand. I’d tried calling a taxi, but the late hour and the blizzard had made it impossible. My only option was to walk, my aching lip throbbing with every step. Stradlater’s fist had connected with my face with a sickening crunch, leaving a painful welt on my nose and a split lip that wouldn't stop bleeding. 

I trudged toward the station, my breath forming white clouds in the frigid air. I stopped to rub some snow on my face, trying to staunch the bleeding.  My reflection in the icy window of a closed shop was a mess - a red stain across my lip, my eyes bloodshot from the fight and the cold. I felt like a character out of a bad movie. 

The station was a haven of warmth and bustle. I found a bench and sat down, feeling the warmth seep into my chilled bones. I watched the passengers hurrying through the station, their faces a kaleidoscope of emotions – worry, anticipation, relief. 

The train came roaring in, its arrival a relief. I boarded the nearly empty carriage, sinking into the plush seat. The hum of the engine and the rhythmic sway of the train were oddly comforting. I didn’t bother reading the magazines or ordering a sandwich. I just sat, watching the world go by, the snowy landscape blurring into a white canvas.

A woman, her face framed by a silver bob, settled into the seat beside me. I caught a glimpse of a worn leather luggage tag with the Pencey Prep emblem.  “Pencey, huh? My son, Ernest Morrow, goes there.” 

Ernest Morrow. The name sparked a flicker of annoyance. A pompous, self-absorbed jerk who had somehow managed to get into Pencey, despite his lack of any real talent or brains.  "Oh, yeah, Ernest. Great guy," I replied, a forced smile plastered on my face. I had no intention of sharing my true opinion of Ernest with this nice lady.

She smiled back, her eyes twinkling. "He's a good boy, Ernest. Very bright, you know. What year is he in?"

"He's a senior, I think," I said, fabricating a story about Ernest's high grades and leadership potential.  I felt a pang of guilt, but the urge to make a good impression on her was stronger. I couldn't help but feel a flicker of pride when she remarked, "He sounds wonderful."

We talked about Pencey, about the teachers and the school. I wove a tapestry of lies, portraying Ernest as a responsible student, a popular athlete, and a well-respected gentleman. The woman, clearly a doting mother, seemed delighted with the picture I painted.

She declined my offer of a drink from the bar car, explaining she needed to get some rest.  As she was leaving, she said, "You're heading home for the holidays, are you?"

"Sort of," I said, my voice flat.  "I have to get some surgery on my brain. It's pretty serious, apparently."

"Oh, honey! I'm so sorry! I hope it goes well," she said, her voice filled with concern.  She squeezed my hand before getting off the train.

I watched her go, feeling a pang of guilt for the lies I had told.  I reached for my phone, wanting to call someone, but I couldn’t decide who.  My parents were probably asleep, and I didn’t want to wake them with my problems.

The train pulled into the station, and I made my way out onto the platform. I hailed a cab and gave him the address of the hotel, then corrected myself quickly, realizing I was going home.

"Hey, do you know anything about the ducks in Central Park?" I asked him, trying to make conversation. 

The cab driver glanced at me in the rearview mirror, then focused back on the road. “No,” he grunted, and that was the end of our conversation.

I paid the fare, got out of the cab, and stood on the curb, feeling lost and alone.  The Edmont Hotel was just down the street. It wasn’t the best hotel, but it was familiar.  I pulled off my hunting hat, trying to blend in with the crowd. I didn’t want to look like a freak.  I needed a place to stay, a place to think. I needed to figure out what to do next.
